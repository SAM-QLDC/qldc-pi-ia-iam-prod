outline general process to how the data flows

current
1. developers submit as built drawings to QGIS
2. fme workbench picks up the latest data since the last time the process was run
3. CSV file created that can be imported into Tech 1
4. CSV file is checked for errors and manually updated to make sure Tech1 accepts the data without errors

future
1. developers submit as built drawings to QGIS
2. GIS data is imported into IAM
3. processes run to clean up data
 a. missing data such as ground levels, inverts etc
 b. condition data updated 
 c. maybe risk
 d. new assets identified - exported to GIS (as and when)
 e. network connectivity check
 f. Tech1 lookup lists checked
4. export to CSV for Tech 1

other
A. check whats in Tech1 against GIS
B. find out how good the GIS data is - perhaphs there are alot of updates
C. if lots of updates then perhaps need to look at the hydraulic models
